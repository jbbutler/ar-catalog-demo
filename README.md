# Butler (2025?) AR Catalog
An (unpublished) catalog of atmospheric river events in Antarctica by James Butler, Michelle Maclennan, and Fernando Perez. This is a catalog of individual storm events tracked through space and time, constructed by spatiotemporally clustering AR pixels in the [Wille (2021)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020JD033788) Eulerian catalog.

## Algorithm Characteristics
- Type: Condition and Track
- Geometry Req.: length > $\deg$
